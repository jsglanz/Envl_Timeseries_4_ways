# Quarterly Comparison

This repo contains code and output for a few of the visuals created for the Smithsonian Marine Station Benthic Ecology Lab's (SMS-BEL) quarterly updates presented during Lake Okeechobee Periodic Scientist Calls and annual reports submitted to the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District.

Including:

-   Current vs Historical CIs: quarterly values from the current year are plotted against the 95% confidence interval around the mean for each environmental and infaunal parameter one site at a time; point shape, ribbon fill, and line type correspond to different depths when applicable

-   Grain Size Heat Maps: grain size composition of sediment cores is investigated once yearly at each of 15 sites; using heat maps, current composition values are compared to the mean of all past values per size class per site

-   Time Series: time series plots are created for environmental and infaunal parameters (ex: sediment water content); plots include standard error bars, trend lines, and correlation coefficient (R) values per depth measured when applicable and arranged with 5 to a page and border colors respective to region (River, Estuary, Lagoon)

-   Lake O Call Q Updates: current quarterly values and 95% confidence intervals (CI's) around the mean of four environmental parameters (turbidity, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and sediment firmness) plotted by site; site is color coded and ordered along the x-axis by region (RIver, Estuary, Lagoon)
